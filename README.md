# Academe
Academe is a platform for students to share and receive advice and educate each other on various academic matters such as the college application process, high school experience, and more. 
Academe focuses on helping students get the answers they need, whether it be to simple homework questions, guidance on the right classes to take in school, or a push in the right direction 
toward discovering their passions on subjects such as computer science, art, and more. Students will be able to collaborate with their peers and teachers through school-specific group chats. 
They will also have the opportunity to connect with a community of Academe mentors and volunteers such as college students to receive advice and explore their interests.
